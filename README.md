# IS1500-Introduction-To-Web-Development
Code created for final project in Introduction To Web Development course

This project was created in Squarespace and had the following requirements:

- at least 5 pages
- at least three images of which at least one must be an animated GIF
- at least one embedded video
- at least one form with JavaScript input field validation and CAPTCHA that performs some kind of calculation and proper error feedback with focus set to "offending" field and using pre-filled forms; the form should be substantially different from the ones built in the labs to receive full credit
- at least one JavaScript hover image with hover text; a hover means that some text area or some other aspect of a web page changes when the mouse moves into an image
- at least one JavaScript image rollover (can be combined with the question above); a rollover means that an image changes when the mouse moves into the image
- at least one Wufoo form that is "hijack proof" and uses CAPTCHA to thwart form robots (be sure to use "secure" links in Wufoo when you grab the embed code)
- at least one page must be dynamic and driven through a database (such as MySQL and PHP and hosted on a server such as AwardSpace); the dynamic page must be substantially different than the one built in the labs; it has to look different and the database should have more fields than the one done as an assignment
- social networking buttons (you must use external social networking widgets for sharing such as AddThis+, but you may use the built-in following buttons)
- a blog (use either Tumblr or Blogspot, but not the built-in blogging platform)
- a user forum (use Muut or Tal.ki or any other forum of your choice. Note: Tal.ki has caused some embedding issues in Squarespace, so you may want to use Muut if you run into problems)
- a poll (use PollDaddy or any other polling platform of your choice)
- titles and meta tags for each page (see this help page and this tutorial on how to do that in Squarespace)
- a store with at least four products and a store front having an integrated shopping cart; products must have full descriptions, prices, sales prices, and pictures; checkout with payment via Square, Stripe, Paypal, or Google Wallet must be possible (you can use the built-in store or any other shopping cart system you like, such as the one offered by Paypal); note that you do NOT have to actually make the payment system work unless you plan on using the web site for purposes beyond the course





Note: The files found in this repo do not display everything done for the project. These files are the code portions of the site that I used along with Squarespace's built in templates/features.
